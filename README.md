<p>I am an AWS SAA Certified with hands-on experience in building modern web applications and
serverless architectures on AWS cloud infrastructure. In a startup environment, I successfully leveraged
AWS services, receiving funding from AWS Activate to support the project development.
<br>
I have extensive experience in the telco industry, including the software development life cycle, legacy
systems, and collaborating with non-technical users for digitization. I can play in both independent
projects and teamwork, focusing on solving business challenges through technology and cloud computing.
<br>
Aside from work, I am also a community builder with a passion for sharing technological knowledge
through webinars, blogs, or tech talks.</p>
